Running on TravisCI. Runner Script for Robot Framework SeleniumLibrary.

Tests are run by giving a path to the tests to be executed as an argument to
this script. Possible Robot Framework options are given before the path.

Examples:
  test.py login_tests                        # Run all tests in a directory
  test.py login_tests/valid_login.text       # Run tests in a specific file
  test.py --variable BROWSER:IE login_tests  # Override variable
  test.py -v BROWSER:IE -v DELAY:0.25 login_tests

By default tests are executed with Firefox browser, but this can be changed
by overriding the `BROWSER` variable as illustrated above. Similarly it is
possible to slow down the test execution by overriding the `DELAY` variable
with a non-zero value.


## ToDos / Ideas 
- Include deployment as a part of test execution
